This is how to run this inside one of the projects created by this project:
- the two biggest unresolved issues before you finish this task:
  - - make a decision on the home teasers and whether you are even going to keep them
  - - make a decision how you are going to do your dark theming, first before you delete this

- npm install purgecss --save-dev
- then, (i did one css file at a time) npx purgecss --css _site/static/css/layout.css --content _site/pariatur/index.html _site/index.html --output clean-layout/
- now that you have the clean css created, you have to manually go through the css and remove from the base css files as your judgement suggests
- select the existing, compare with the new cleaned version, analyze the delta
- absolutely search through all html first before removing stuff
